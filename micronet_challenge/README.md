# MicroNet Challenge Counting Operations and Parameters.

This folder includes tools for counting operations and parameters of a neural
network. Using the tools at `counting.py` we count the operations and parameters
of the base [EfficientNet model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946) (see the
colab). 

For more information about the competation and the rules please visit the
