# Practical and Consistent Estimation of f-Divergences

This Colab accompanies the NeurIPS 2019 paper:<br/>
"Practical and Consistent Estimation of f-Divergences" <br/>
Paul K. Rubenstein, Olivier Bousquet, Josip Djolonga, Carlos Riquelme and Ilya Tolstikhin <br/>

By default precomputed results are loaded for plotting, but ticking the
appropriate boxes in the Colab allows the experiments to be run from scratch.

See requirements.txt for required packages if running locally.
